## Scope of local verification

The execution environment used for this release has NumPy/SciPy/pytest/psutil but does not have `anndata` or `veckit`, and outbound package installation is unavailable. Code that depends on those packages imports them lazily; its pure logic and adapters are unit-tested here, and GitHub Actions is configured to install declared dependencies in a normal public CI environment. Dependency-free CLIs were additionally exercised end-to-end.

This limitation is recorded rather than hidden: the repository is release-ready, but a publisher should still let the included CI matrix run after putting it on GitHub.
